# rubasciicube

A Rubik's Cube in ASCII.

The cube blocks are represented by colored ASCII characters.

The faces are represented by letters (u=upper, f=front, l=left, r=right, d=down, b=back).
The move direction is clockwise by default. To move the face in counter-clockwise, add 'i' to the face letter.

Example: The sequence 'f li ui b' rotates the front (clockwise), the left and upper face (counter-clockwise) and then the back (clockwise).

After each move the cube is printed.

There is a 'loop' option in the menu where one can pass a sequence to be reproduced in a loop until the original state is achieved.
When this happens, the number of movements is printed.

Enjoy it!
